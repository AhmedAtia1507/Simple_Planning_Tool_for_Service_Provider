# Simple Planning Tool for Service Provider using MATLAB
- Using MATLAB, I designed a simple planning tool for a service provider that owns 340 channels in the 900 MHz band.
- The MATLAB code asks for the GOS "Grade of Service", city area, user density, SIR_min "minimum signal-to-interference ratio" and sectorization method.
